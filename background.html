    <h2>History of Python – Why was it invented?</h2>
    <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was capable of exception handling and interfacing with systems like the Amoeba operating system. Implementation began in December 1989, and Python 0.9.0 was released on February 20, 1991. Van Rossum served as the lead developer until 2018. The language was invented to address limitations in ABC, emphasizing readability, simplicity, and a large extensible standard library over built-in core functionality. It draws influences from languages like ABC, C, Perl, and Lisp.</p>
    
    <h2>Language Category and Programming Styles</h2>
    <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming styles, including procedural (structured), object-oriented, functional, and aspect-oriented (via extensions).</p>
    
    <h2>Types of Applications Mostly Used</h2>
    <p>Python is commonly used for web development (e.g., Django framework for building websites like Instagram), data science and machine learning (e.g., Pandas for data analysis in tools like Google Colab), automation scripting (e.g., automating file management), and scientific computing (e.g., NumPy for numerical simulations). Sample: A simple web app using Flask: <code>from flask import Flask; app = Flask(__name__); @app.route('/'); def hello(): return 'Hello, World!';</code></p>
    
    <h2>Is Python Currently Popular?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Python remains highly popular in 2025. According to Statista, 57.9% of developers worldwide use Python as of 2025<grok-card data-id="163ec7" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>. The PYPL index shows Python at 27.3% share<grok-card data-id="2264e6" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>, and the TIOBE Index ranks it #1 in November 2025<grok-card data-id="3f384e" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>. The Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025 notes a 7% increase in adoption from 2024<grok-card data-id="d56cc9" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>.</p>

    <h2>Implementation Method</h2>
    <p>Python supports a combination of methods: The reference implementation is CPython (compiled to bytecode and interpreted), with alternatives like PyPy (just-in-time compilation), Jython (compiled to Java bytecode), and IronPython (for .NET).</p>
    
    <h2>Programming Environments Available</h2>
    <p>Available environments include IDLE (bundled IDE), PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook (for interactive computing), and IPython (enhanced shell).</p>
