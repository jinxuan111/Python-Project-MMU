    <h1>3. Sample Application</h1>
    <p>The sample is a number guessing game in Python (source code above in basic elements).</p>
    
    <h2>Design of System Features with Flowchart and Description</h2>
    <p>Flowchart (text-based):</p>
    <pre>
Start
  |
Generate random number (1-100)
  |
Loop: Input user guess
  |  
Compare guess to number
 /  \  
Too low? -> Print "Too low!" -> Increment attempts -> Loop
Too high? -> Print "Too high!" -> Increment attempts -> Loop
Correct? -> Print "Correct! Attempts: X" -> End
    </pre>
    <p>Description: The system generates a random number, takes user inputs in a loop, compares them, provides feedback, and ends when correct.</p>
    
    <h2>Output of Each System Feature</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Random number generation: Internal, no direct output.</li>
        <li>User input: Prompts "Guess a number between 1 and 100: " and reads input.</li>
        <li>Comparison: Outputs "Too low!", "Too high!", or "Correct! It took X attempts."</li>
    </ul>
