    <h1>2. Basic Elements of Python (with Source Codes from Sample Application)</h1>
    <p>The sample application is a simple number guessing game. Full code:</p>
    <pre>
import random

def guess_number():
    number = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0
    while True:
        guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))
        attempts += 1
        if guess < number:
            print("Too low!")
        elif guess > number:
            print("Too high!")
        else:
            print(f"Correct! It took {attempts} attempts.")
            break

guess_number()
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Names and Bindings (Lecture 6)</h2>
    <p>Names like 'number', 'attempts', and 'guess' are bound to values dynamically. Python uses late binding, where types are checked at runtime. Example: <code>number = random.randint(1, 100)</code> binds 'number' to an integer.</p>
    
    <h2>Expressions and Assignment (Lecture 7)</h2>
    <p>Expressions include arithmetic like <code>attempts += 1</code> (assignment with addition). Assignment: <code>guess = int(input(...))</code> converts input to int and assigns.</p>
    
    <h2>Control Structures (Lecture 8)</h2>
    <p>Uses a while loop: <code>while True:</code> for indefinite iteration, and conditional: <code>if guess < number: ... elif ... else: ...</code>.</p>
    
    <h2>Subprograms (Lecture 9)</h2>
    <p>The function <code>def guess_number():</code> is a subprogram that encapsulates the game logic. It's called at the end: <code>guess_number()</code>.</p>
